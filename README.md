# LocalDnsServerCpp
Local DNS Server - C++



# Installation

### Windows
On Windows, there is no DNS Server already installed and running, making the
installation something easy.
The DNS cache is managed by the operating system (made by "dnsmasq" in some distributions of Linux).


### Linux

[Tested with Ubuntu]

```cmd
sudo pkill dns
```


```cmd
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

add
```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```
put in comment others :
```
# nameserver 212.27.40.240
```

Result :

```
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN

# nameserver 212.27.40.240
# nameserver 212.27.40.241

nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

```cmd
sudo pkill dnsmasq
```


Get the list of process using the port 53 :
```cmd
sudo netstat -lanp |grep ":53 "
```

Run it after compilation :
```cmd
sudo ./localdnsservercpp
```


Restart the cache "dnsmasq" after having stopped localdnsservercpp :
```cmd
sudo dnsmasq
```
